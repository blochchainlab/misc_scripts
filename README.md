# Miscellaneous small scripts

Inspect bvec to compare the quality of the approximate uniform spread with and without antipodal symmetry  

Fit DTI over multi-shell dataset to evaluate diffusivity for postmortem scan  




### TODO  
List each script with more details  
Give example call for each script  
List dependencies for each script (especially the rare-ish one like dipy or scilpy)
